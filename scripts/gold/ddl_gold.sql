/*
    This script defines the **Gold Layer** views in a Data Warehouse architecture.

    The Gold Layer represents the final, business-ready presentation layer 
    used for analytics, dashboards, and reporting.

    It includes:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. gold.dim_customers:
       - A cleaned and enriched customer dimension view.
       - Combines CRM and ERP data to include demographics and personal details.
       - Handles missing or unknown gender values using fallback logic.

    2. gold.dim_products:
       - A detailed product dimension view with business categories and status.
       - Filters out historical (discontinued) products.
       - Joins product master data with product classification info.

    3. gold.fact_sales:
       - A sales fact view linking customers and products to transactional data.
       - Enriched with surrogate keys (customer_key, product_key) from dimensions.
       - Serves as the core fact table for BI reporting on sales performance.

    These views are not materialized â€” they are always up to date 
    with the underlying Silver Layer data.
